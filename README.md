My Python Learning
--------------------
1) Used Lists and random module for the RockPaperScissors project. 
RPS rules are: Rock wins against scissors, Scissors win against paper, Paper wins against rock.
Logic used: rock = 0, paper = 1, scissors = 2
Check: if 0 > 2, 2 > 1, 1 > 0 . 
Enjoy the game :)

2) Number Guessing game is to allow the player to submit a guess for a number between 1 and 100.
There are two different difficulty levels.
It will check user's guess against actual answer.
I have used the local and global variable declaration. Enjoy the game :)

3) Welcome to Treasure Island. Your mission is to find the treasure. Used mostly if and elif statements.
   Enjoy the game :)
